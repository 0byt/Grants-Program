We will use a server authoritative model embedded with our web3 backend via the substrate modules created in deliverable 1.

To start a match, the server must request that a \"match\" be created on chain via ink! smart contract after collecting a nominal fee from connected players. The server will also request the information necessary to spawn environment enemies in the game map from owned NFTs on chain at random. Lastly, players will spawn and game play will begin. In game events, such as when a player eliminates another player or environment enemy, will be written to chain. These streams of game commands which make up the packets sent by the client to the server are used to compensate for latency with methods like prediction and interpolation. Our engine will be similar to that used in Quake (id Software, Microsoft) and Half-Life (Valve, Sierra Studios), using various methods to compensate for latency and ensure a pleasant user experience, the key difference being that interactions leading to specific events will be logged to the chain.
