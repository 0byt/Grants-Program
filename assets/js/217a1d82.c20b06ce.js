Within this context, we have engaged in discussions with the System Parachain team, particularly Joe, who has expressed support for the inclusion of our proposed TWAMM extension onto the Asset Hub.

These conversations have provided positive reinforcement for our vision and reinforced the potential value that our solution can bring to the Asset Hub."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"We would like to bring to your attention that we recently presented a similar, albeit more extensive and expansive, proposal to the Polkadot Treasury, which unfortunately did not succeed (",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/408"},"Motion #408"),").

This would offer an alternative to exclusively routing such trades to specialized chains like HydraDX. Interested parties seeking a more efficient implementation may choose to execute transactions through HydraDX, as extensively discussed in various DEX deliberations. Additionally, Joe Petrowski's endorsement has reaffirmed our belief in this perspective, prompting us to refine our approach.
