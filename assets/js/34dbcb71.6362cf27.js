As in the VBFL paper, at every communication round, each device will be randomly appointed as one of the three roles defined as follows: (1) "Data Contributors" can occasionally take on the role of "machine learning worker," as described in the VBFL paper. (2) The role of "model validator" will be an extension of our existing validation processes. This role will employ advanced validation techniques like k-fold and stratified sampling to ensure the integrity and accuracy of model training.
