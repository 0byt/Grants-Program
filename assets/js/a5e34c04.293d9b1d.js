Any parachain user can create and fund feeds, which are fulfilled by oracle reporters which have deposited a stake to the Oracle contract on the smart contract parachain.  Once completed, integrating and testing the pallet and the controller contracts will take significant work and documentation in order to make a robust and user-friendly oracle module.
